# Task-2
Comprises of the task assigned on 27-05-2025 and observations made 
1.	Spelling Mistakes
  Words like "detetced" (should be detected) and "unknow device" (should be unknown device) show that the sender is careless or fake. Real companies check their emails before sending them.
2.	Scary and Urgent Language
  Sentences like “verify your identity within 12 hours” or “your account will be suspended” are made to scare you. Trusted companies don’t use threats to force quick action.
3.	Fake Link (Looks Real at First)
  The link says "Click here to verify now," but it takes you to a website like micro-sift-security-verification.com, which is made to look like Microsoft but is not real. This is called a mismatched or fake link.
4.	No HTTPS (Not Secure)
  The link starts with http://, not https://. This means your info isn’t safe if you click it. Trusted websites always use https for protection.
5.	No Personal Touch
  The email doesn’t use your name. It just says something like “Dear user.” Real emails from trusted companies usually mention your name or account info.
6.	Fake Email Address
  The sender’s email looks like Microsoft, but it’s really from micr0s0ft-support.com (notice the "0" instead of "o"). This is a trick called email spoofing.
7.	Fails Security Checks (Advanced Tip)
  When checking the email’s header, we can see that important checks like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC fail. That means the email is not from who it says it is.
